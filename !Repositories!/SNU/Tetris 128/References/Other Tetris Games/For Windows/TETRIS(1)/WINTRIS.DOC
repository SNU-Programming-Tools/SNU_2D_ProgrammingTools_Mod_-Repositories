WINTRIS  (TETRIS for MS WINDOWS)
 
Purpose:
    The purpose of the game is to fill as many horizontal lines as possible.
    When a line is filled it disappears and all of the blocks above it shift 
    down.
 
Motion:
    to move a block right press: '6' or right arrow or right mouse button
    to move a block left  press: '4' or left  arrow or left  mouse button
    to rotate a block press: '5' or empty key on NumPad or middle mouse button
    to drop a block press: '2' or down arrow or space bar
    (when using mouse, make sure the pointer is inside the window)
 
 
Scoring:
    Points are scored every time a line or several lines disappear.  If you
    used a 'drop' key and the block made a line(s) disappear,
    you will receive more points, depending on how far the block fell.
    Also the more lines disappear at the same time, the more points are
    awarded.  If 1 line disappears you get 1 point; if 2 lines
    disappear you get 2 points per line for a total of 4 points; if
    3 lines disappear you get 3 points per line for a total of 9 points;
    and 16 points for 4 disappearing lines.

    The score is kept in the caption bar. There are two numbers separated
    by a ':'; the one on the right is your current score and the one on the
    left is your current speed level.  Speed level increases every time
    50 blocks have been dropped.  You can also start with a higher speed
    by choosing the appropriate level at the beginning of the game.
 
Other Features:
    You can increase your current speed level by pressing "Ctrl+F".
    And you can decrease your current speed level by pressing "Ctrl+S".
    You cannot slow down below your starting level; thus, if you started
    at speed level 5 and are currently playing at level seven, the lowest
    speed level that you can go to is 5.

    For a more challenging game, you can choose to have some lines filled
    when the game starts.  The number of pre-filled lines can be chosen
    from the score board dialog.

    You can restart the game by  pressing "Ctrl+N", at this point you will
    get a list of the top ten scores and can choose a different speed level and
    starting number of lines filled.

    The game terminates when there is no more room for falling blocks.
    If your score is in the top ten, then you will be prompted for your name.
    Top ten scores are kept in the file -- 'wintris.scr'.
